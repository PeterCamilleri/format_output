# FormatOutput

The format_output gem is a CLI utility for formatting data as bullet points,
columns, or with word wrap to the console, strings, or arrays of strings.

This gem started out life buried deep within the mysh gem where it served as
the data formatting facility for that program. Such was the utility of these
methods that the long task of splitting them away from mysh was started.

Along the way, additional capabilities were added to flesh out range of
available formatting transformations.

## Installation
