# FormatOutput

The format_output gem is used to facilitate the creation of CLI programs in
Ruby by formatting data as bullet points, columns, or word wrap to the console,
strings, or arrays of strings.

This gem started out life buried deep within the mysh gem where it served as
the data formatting facility for that program. Such was the usefulness of these
methods that the long task of splitting them away from mysh was started.

Along the way, additional capabilities were added to flesh out range of
available formatting transformations. The following  are taken from the
format_output unit test suite and include:

#### Columns

Neat, efficient columns of data are nice:

    0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95
    1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 41 46 51 56 61 66 71 76 81 86 91 96
    2 7 12 17 22 27 32 37 42 47 52 57 62 67 72 77 82 87 92 97
    3 8 13 18 23 28 33 38 43 48 53 58 63 68 73 78 83 88 93 98
    4 9 14 19 24 29 34 39 44 49 54 59 64 69 74 79 84 89 94 99

#### Bullet Points

How about making some (bullet) points:

    Name      Wiley Coyote
    Education Super Genius
    Incident  Run over by a large truck
    Status    Flattened and accordion like

#### Word Wrap

Well long text can be hard to (word) wrap your head around:

    There are many many stars in the
    heavens. Lots really. Like billions and
    billions

    There are many many fishies in the sea.
    Lots really. Like billions and billions

    There are many many birds in the sky.
    Lots really. Like billions and billions


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'format_output'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install format_output

## Usage

#### Formatting Control Parameters

The formatting of output is controlled by four parameters. These are:

Parameter| Description                                                       | Default
---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------
width    |The overall width of the output "stage".                           | 80
left     |The size of the left margin. White space to the left of the data.  | 0
body     |The center of the "stage" where the formatted data resides.        | 80
right    |The size of the right margin. White space to the right of the data.| 0

These relationships are illustrated below:

    |<----------- width ------------>|
    |left |<------ body ------>|right|
    |     | 1  4  7  10  13  16|     |
    |     | 2  5  8  11  14  17|     |
    |     | 3  6  9  12  15  18|     |

In many cases however, the programmer will not need to modify these parameters.
That is the defaults values provided are suitable for most application.

If the defaults are not suitable, there are two approaches that are available:

1. The global parameters can be changed. For example:

    FormatOutput.width = 132

2. the parameters can be set for one call only. For example:

    my_array.format_output_columns(left: 5, right: 5)


Note: The format_output parameters are connected in that they define the same
formatting work area. As a result, the following interactions occur:

    FormatOutput.left            # Gets the left margin
    FormatOutput.left  = value   # Sets the left margin
    FormatOutput.right           # Gets the left margin
    FormatOutput.right = value   # Sets the left margin
    FormatOutput.width           # Gets the full width
    FormatOutput.width = value   # Sets the full width
    FormatOutput.body            # Gets width - (left + right)
    FormatOutput.width = value   # Sets width = value + left + right

As can be seen, setting the body and setting the other parameters does interact
quite a bit. So these rules should be followed:

* Always set left and right margins before setting the body. Otherwise, the
body setting will be modified to a value other than the set value.
* Don't set both the body and the width as only the last will have effect.
